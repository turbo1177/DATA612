#Module 1
#create code for a Write a Python code that defines a function named total, which takes two integers as arguments (num1, num2), and returns the total of the numbers within the range of these two numbers (num1, num2). For example, if the function received the numbers 1 and 4, it should return the total of the numbers in between, 1+2+3+4, which is 10. Please see the sample runs below. Please note that you need to implement the function in two different ways using:

# A) While loop
# B) For loop
